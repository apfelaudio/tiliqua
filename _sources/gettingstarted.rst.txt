Getting started

Building example projects
-------------------------

Each top-level bitstream has a command-line interface. You can see the options by running (for example):

.. code-block:: bash

   # from `gateware` directory
   pdm dsp

The available options change depending on the top-level project. For example, many projects have video output, and from the CLI you can select the video resolution.

A few examples of building top-level bitstreams:

.. code-block:: bash

   # from `gateware` directory

   # for the selftest bitstream (prints diagnostics out DVI and serial)
   pdm selftest build
   # for a vectorscope / oscilloscope
   pdm xbeam build
   # for a polyphonic MIDI synth
   pdm polysyn build
   # for the LUNA-based 4in + 4out USB soundcard example
   # note: LUNA USB port presents itself on the second USB port (not dbg)!
   pdm usb_audio build
   # for a 4-channel waveshaping oscillator
   pdm dsp build --dsp-core nco
   # for a diffusion delay effect
   pdm dsp build --dsp-core diffuser
   # simplified vectorscope (no SoC / menu system)
   pdm vectorscope_no_soc build

Generally, bitstreams are also built in CI - check ``.github/workflows`` if you need more gruesome details on how systems are built.

Flashing example projects
-------------------------

The built-in RP2040 JTAG debugger is based on the ``dirtyJtag`` project. For non-SoC projects that don't require extra firmware, you can directly flash bitstreams to the SRAM of the FPGA like so:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo openFPGALoader -c dirtyJtag build/top.bit

When you build a project from the command line, on completion they will usually print some instructions on how to flash them. For SoC bitstreams, there may be multiple steps (e.g. bitstream and firmware, or other artifacts). You can add the :code:`--flash` option to perform these steps automatically.

.. warning::

    If you flash with to the SPI flash, usually you will want to specify
    an offset so you don't overwrite the bootloader. See the *Bootloader* section
    for more information on flash addressing. In any case it's not possible to
    brick the Tiliqua - so don't be too scared to play!

If you are running an SoC, once you have flashed all artifacts it will give you serial output that you can monitor like so:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo picocom -b 115200 /dev/ttyACM0

Simulating DSP cores
--------------------

The easiest way to debug the internals of a DSP project is to simulate it. This project provides some shortcuts to enable simulating designs end-to-end with Verilator (at some point these will be migrated to Amaranths CXXRTL simulation backend, once it lands).

For example, to simulate the waveshaping oscillator example:

.. code-block:: bash

   # from `gateware` directory
   pdm dsp sim --dsp-core nco

In short this command:

- Elaborates your Amaranth HDL and convert it to Verilog
- Verilates your verilog into a C++ implementation, compiling it against ``sim_dsp_core.cpp`` provided in ``gateware/top/dsp`` that excites the audio inputs (you can modify this).
- Runs the verilated binary itself and spits out a trace you can view with ``gtkwave`` to see exactly what every net in the whole design is doing.

Simulating SoC cores
--------------------

A subset of SoC-based top-level projects also support end-to-end simulation (i.e including firmware co-simulation). For example, for the selftest SoC:

.. code-block:: bash

   # from `gateware` directory
   pdm selftest sim

   # ...

   run verilated binary 'build/obj_dir/Vtiliqua_soc'...
   sync domain is: 60000 KHz (16 ns/cycle)
   pixel clock is: 74250 KHz (13 ns/cycle)
   [INFO] Hello from Tiliqua selftest!
   [INFO] PSRAM memtest (this will be slow if video is also active)...
   [INFO] write speed 1687 KByte/seout frame00.bmp
   c
   [INFO] read speed 1885 KByte/sec
   [INFO] PASS: PSRAM memtest

UART traffic from the firmware is printed to the terminal, and each video frame is emitted as a bitmap. This kind of simulation is useful for debugging the integration of top-level SoC components.

Simulating vectorscope core
---------------------------

There is a top-level ``vectorscope_no_soc`` provided which is also useful for debugging integration issues between the video and memory controller cores. This can be simulated end-to-end as follows (``--trace-fst`` is also useful for saving waveform traces):

.. code-block:: bash

   # from `gateware` directory
   pdm vectorscope_no_soc sim --trace-fst

Using the ILA
-------------

Some cores support using a built-in ILA (integrated logic analyzer), to collect waveform traces on the hardware into on-FPGA block RAM, which is sampled at the system clock and dumped out the serial port.

For example:

.. code-block:: bash

   # from `gateware` directory
   pdm vectorscope_no_soc build --ila --ila-port /dev/ttyACM0

This will build the bitstream containing the ILA, flash the bitstream, then open the provided serial port waiting for an ILA dump from the Tiliqua to arrive. Once received, the dump will be saved to a waveform trace file.

.. note::
   You may have to play with permissions for flashing to work correctly - make sure ``openFPGALoader`` can run locally under your user without ``sudo``.
